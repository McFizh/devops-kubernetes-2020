Tanzu (Pivotal) vs OpenShift:

Tanzu (Pivotal):

+ Run on multiple Linux distros
- Architechture contains propietary components
- Strong preference towards vmware as platform to run on
- Pricing model is based on number of pods
- Prefers only stateless applications


OpenShift:

- Openshift is more geared toward tech savvy people with somewhat more complex setup
- Requires RHEL distribution to run
+ Stack is build mostly on open source software
+ Doesn't really define the preferred platform type (plain hardware vs virtualized platform)
+ Pricing model is based on worker node core count (so efficient apps reduce overall costs)
+ Un-opinionated: Allow to run either stateful or stateless applications

And the winner is: Openshift
